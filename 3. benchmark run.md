# Lab 3: Compile and Launch a load test run on Inf1 Instance.

**Please complete Lab 2 and clean up by following Lab 2's last step.**

**3.1** Download and unpack the ResNet50 performance package on Inf1 instance:

```bash
wget https://reinventinf1.s3.amazonaws.com/keras_fp16_benchmarking_db.tgz
```
```bash
tar -xzf keras_fp16_benchmarking_db.tgz
```
```bash
cd keras_fp16_benchmarking_db
```

**3.2** Compile ResNet50 frozen graph using provided pb2sm_compile.py script on Inf1 instance
>We optimized this model with a compiled time batch size of 5. We optimize throughput having a runtime batch size of mutiples of 5. (50 in this case). This step takes about 6 minutes.

```bash
source test_env_p36/bin/activate
pip install neuron-cc
```
```bash
time python pb2sm_compile.py
```

**3.3** Run load test using provided infer_rn50_tf_db.py script on Inf1 instance:

> There are total of 4 Neuron Cores on Inf1.2xlarge.  There are 4 sessions of ResNet50 running, each session binds to a Neuron core. There are 4 threads in each of these sessions.  

```bash
time python infer_rn50_tf_db.py
```
Output:

```

**3.4** While this is running you can see utilization using neuron-top tool in a separate terminal (it takes about a minute to load; also running neuron-top will lower the throughput to around 1200 images/sec):
```bash
/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-top
```

**Note: Please go back to home directory /home/ubuntu**

```bash
cd ~/
```
