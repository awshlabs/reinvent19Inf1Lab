# Simple Load testing of the Inf1 Instance

1.1. ResNet50 Performance package timing

```bash
wget https://reinventinf1.s3.amazonaws.com/keras_fp16_benchmarking_db.tgz
```
```bash
tar -xzf keras_fp16_benchmarking_db.tgz
```
```bash
cd keras_fp16_benchmarking_db
```
There are two main scripts:

1.2. Compile:
We optimized this model with a compiled time batch size of 5. We optimize throughput having a runtime batch size of mutiples of 5. (50 in this case). This step takes about 6 minutes.

```bash
source test_env_p36/bin/activate
pip install neuron-cc
```
```bash
time python pb2sm_compile.py
```

1.3 Run Load test: Infer (make sure this is on Inf1, and neuron-rtd is running):

> There are total of 4 Neuron Cores on Inf1.2xlarge.  There are 4 sessions of ResNet50 running, each session binds to a Neuron core. There are 4 threads in each of these sessions.  

```bash
time python infer_rn50_tf_db.py
```
Output:

```

1.4. While this is running you can see utilization using neuron-top tool in a separate terminal (this will lower the throughput to around 1200 images/sec):
```bash
/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-top
```
